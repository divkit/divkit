Fixes:

## 24.0.0 (April 3, 2023)

Breaking changes:
* The `setVariable` / `GetVariable` methods have been removed (these methods were deprecated long time ago before opensource, in web version 1.11.0)
* DivKit now uses `BigInt` internally if it is supported by the current platform. This also means that variable methods such as `subscribe` can now return `bigint` values instead of `number` (and accept such values in json). `integer` values in expressions are now limited to 64 bits instead of 32, and the minimum/maximum value for `integer` variables has been changed. Note that outside of expressions, DivKit restricts values to 32-bit integers, as was the case in previous versions. Also note that the js builtin methods, such as `JSON.parse`, return a simple `number`, so these values may lose accuracy outside the logic of DivKit. Make sure that your values are in the range `-2^53 â€” 2^53` or a custom json parsing function is used

Additions:
* Functions for getting `datetime ` components
* Functions for getting value of a variable, if it exists. `getStringValue`, `getIntegerValue`, etc

Fixes and changes:
* `timers` ticks should now be more accurate and reliable. Time intervals would correct time error, there is also an extra tick before end the duration if the ticks doesn't trigger in time
* `visibility_action` actions will now evaluate expressions on the trigger, and not when the creating the component


## 23.4.0 (March 1, 2023)

Added:
* `aspect` support for `container` (`aspect-ratio` css property support is required!)

Fixes:
* Updated missing function error text, to better match other platforms

Shape objects support in `slider` was also updated

Fixed:
* `padStart` / `padEnd` now will work properly with an empty `pad_str` argument

## 11.0.0 (October 12, 2022)

Additions:
* Support for the `wrap` layout mode in a `container`
* Support for the `cross_spacing` property in `gallery`

* Support for the `appearance_animation` in `image`
* Support for the `restrict_parent_scroll` property in `tabs`, `gallery` and `pager`
* Root states are now properly supported

Changes and fixes:
* Updated the `wrap_content` logic, this would lead to a different layout in some corner-cases
* Boolean values from exressions are now correctly converted to the string `false` / `true` in the `text` block
* The layout of the `slider` has been changed to sync with other platforms, now the text offset will not change the size of the component. Also now there may be more than 20 ticks
* Updated color functions according to the latest changes. Now several of them would return the type `color` instead of `string` (rgb, rgba, setColorRed and others)
* Components will now correctly unregister when destroyed, so recreated elements will work properly (for example, actions to change the current element in the gallery, nested state elements and others)
* Fixed logic of expression processing Previously, if a string was considered an "expression", it was processed as it, otherwise it would be used as a simple string. But sometimes this check worked incorrectly and processed expressions as a string. This is now fixed. It also means that some strings will now require proper escaping, so be sure to check this in your project (previously,these strings "just worked" without escaping because they were not treated as expressions)
* Now elements with custom actions can be focused, as it was with simple URLs. This would result to better accessibility in such cases (these elements also accept the keyboard input!)
* Fixed the visibility of the `gallery` arrows on desktops in several cases
* Fixed a case where`transition_in`, `transition_out` and `transition_change` incorrectly discarded the `alpha` component property
* Component actions will now wait for the result of each of them. This means that you can create an array using 2 actions: one to change the state, and the second to change the created component inside the state
