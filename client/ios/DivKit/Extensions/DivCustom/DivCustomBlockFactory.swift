/// A protocol that allows you to handle situations where you require a complex layout that cannot
/// be fully expressed using standard components in DivKit.

/// By implementing `DivCustomBlockFactory`, you can define your custom block factory, responsible
/// for creating blocks based on custom data and context.
///
/// To conform to this protocol, create a type that provides an implementation for the
/// ``makeBlock(data:context:)`` method. This method should return a ``LayoutKit.Block`` that
/// represents your custom layout.
///
/// For more information and usage examples, you can refer to the [example implementation](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/blob/main/client/ios/DivKitPlayground/DivKit/PlaygroundDivCustomBlockFactory.swift).

  ///   - data: The custom data used to generate the block layout.

  /// - Returns: A `Block` that represents the custom layout defined by this factory.
