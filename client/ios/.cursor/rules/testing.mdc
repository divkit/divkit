# Mocking

Don't create new mock classes for these classes, use simplest inits:

DivKitComponents
DivBlockModelingContext -> MockDivBlockModelingContext
DivBlockStateStorage
ExpressionResolver

DivData - use DivBuilders.swift to create DivData for testing


# Adding New Test .swift Files

When adding new test files to the project, you need to update the Xcode project configuration to include them:

1. Create your test file in the appropriate directory under LayoutKitTests or DivKitTests
2. Add the file to the Xcode project by updating the project.pbxproj file in public/client/ios/DivKit.xcodeproj:
   - Add a PBXBuildFile entry to include the file in the build
   - Add a PBXFileReference entry to define the file
   - Add the file to the appropriate group in the project structure
   - Add the file to the Sources build phase for the corresponding test target

Without these steps, the test file won't be discovered and run as part of the test suite.
