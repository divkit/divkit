# Description

DivKit contains various test types defined in JSON files with specific structures. These files are parsed by each platform (iOS, Android, Web) to construct platform-specific tests that validate the functionality described in the test cases.

All test data are stored in the `public/test_data/` directory.

# Guidelines

When creating test files, adhere to these principles:
- Design minimal div cards that focus on testing a single feature or behavior.
- Keep it simple and straightforward. Avoid creating multiple test cases for similar scenarios.
- Use descriptive variable names and readable text content. Make variables trivial.
- Cover edge cases and common usage patterns.
- Each test should validate one specific aspect independently.
- Avoid platform-specific features unless testing platform differences.

# Test structure comprehension

The `.roo/rules-divkit-documentation-writer/public-documentation-structure.md` file provides functionality to access public documentation resources that help comprehend test structures and architecture.
