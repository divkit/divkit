How ios divkit convert json to views:

0. Files in `div-schema` folder describe format of div json files for all platforms.
Swift Div structs are generated from div-schema with `divkit/client/ios/codegen_DivKit.sh`
This script updates files in `generated_output` folder.
1. JSON is parsed into Div classes (DivKit/generated_sources/*.swift)
2. Div classes are converted to Block classes (LayoutKit/LayoutKit/Blocks/*.swift) inside Div*Extensions (DivKit/Extensions/Div*Extensions.swift)
3. Block classes are rendered as UIViews (LayoutKit/LayoutKit/UI/Blocks/*+UIViewRenderableBlock.swift)
