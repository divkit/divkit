  /// The maximum size by which we can compress block is:
  /// `constrainedBlock.size - constrainedBlock.minSize`
  /// We can sort array by this value and then give the sizes to the blocks in `O(nlogn)`
  /// But an additional condition is to compress proportionally.
  /// Let's look at 2 constrained blocks with sizes `s1`, `s2`.
  /// If we descreased `s1` by `x` point, `s2` descreased by `s2.size / s1.size * x` points.
  /// Let's add a coefficient that normalizes blocks relative to the minimum block size.
  /// Let `smin`  be the block with the minimum size.
  /// If we descreased `s1` by `x` point, `s2` descreased by
  /// `x / (s1.size / smin.size) * (s2.size / smin.size)` points,
  /// which equal `s2.size / s1.size * x` points.
  /// Let `coefficient` is `block.size / blockmin.size` value.
  ///
  /// So how do we find the block that will shrink to a minimum the fastest?
  /// This is the block with the minimum value of
  /// `(constrainedBlock.size - constrainedBlock.minSize) / coef`
  ///
  /// Algorithm:
  /// ```
  /// 1) Let's sort the blocks in ascending order of the possibility of compression.
  /// 2) At the i-th iteration, we will try to compress the i-th block.
  /// We can compress i-th block by
  /// min(block.size - block.minSize - currentBlockDecrease * block.coefficient,
  ///     lengthToDecrease / sum(sortedBlocks[i..n].coefficient) * block.coefficient)
  /// ```
