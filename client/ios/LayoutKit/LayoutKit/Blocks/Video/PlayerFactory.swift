/// The ``PlayerFactory`` protocol allows you to set a custom player factory that utilizes its own
/// engine for video playback. By conforming to this protocol, you can define your own video player
/// implementation, allowing you to use a different video playback engine other than the default one
/// provided by `AVFoundation`.
///
/// The ``PlayerFactory`` protocol requires the implementation of two methods:
/// - ``makePlayer(data:config:)``: This method should create and return a `Player` object based on
/// the provided `VideoData` and `PlaybackConfig`.
/// - ``makePlayerView()``: This method should create and return a `PlayerView` that visually
/// displays the video content.
///
/// By adopting this protocol, you gain the flexibility to use custom video playback solutions,
/// which can be beneficial when you have specific requirements or prefer alternative video handling
/// mechanisms. It allows you to integrate third-party video players or your own player
/// implementation seamlessly into your DivKit card.
