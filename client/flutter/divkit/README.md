DivKit üêã is an open source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework. It allows you to roll out server-sourced updates to different app versions. Also, it can be used for fast UI prototyping, allowing you to write a layout once and then ship it anywhere using Flutter. DivKit is an excellent choice to start using server-driven UI in your project because it can be easily integrated as a simple view in any part of your app. At the starting point, you don‚Äôt need a server integration. You can include all JSON on the client-side to try it in a real-world application.

Also, we‚Äôve made a [sandbox](https://divkit.tech/playground) for you to experiment with. You can try different samples in the web editor and see the results. You can use the [DivKit website](https://divkit.tech/en) to find a lot of handy samples and documentation, but feel free to ask us anything in the Telegram community chat.

## How it works

DivKit builds native views from JSON data.

JSON ‚Üí DivData ‚Üí DivKitView

- JSON ‚Äì raw data with templates in DivKit format (see [DivKit schema](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/schema)).

- DivData ‚Äì data objects parsed from JSON (see [Generated DTO](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/client/flutter/divkit/lib/src/schema)).

- DivKitView ‚Äî plain Flutter Widget (you use it directly)

## Playground app
Since the Flutter client does not support full-fledged launch on the web, therefore, in order to poke the functionality, you need to run an example of the current library. Use [DivKit playground app](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/client/flutter/divkit/example) to look through layout examples and supported functions.

The main part of samples is stored in monorepositry... Before starting, call the following command from `client/flutter/divkit` to create a soft link to them: 
```shell
  ./tool/get_test_data.sh
```

## DivKit Flutter. Quick start.
### Build app and draw your first DivKitView.

1. Add dependency to pubspec.yaml:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        divkit: any
    ```
2. Import library
    ```dart
    import 'package:divkit/divkit.dart';
    ```
3. Resolve your layout with DivKitData:

    from JSON:
    ```dart
    final data = DefaultDivKitData.fromJson(json); // json is Map<String, dynamic>
    ```
    or from card and templates:
    ```dart
    final data = DefaultDivKitData.fromScheme(
        card: json['card'], // Map<String, dynamic>
        templates: json['templates'], // Map<String, dynamic>?
    );
    ```

    P.s. The process of building a DTO is quite expensive, so it is better to create it outside the widget in order to avoid frame loss.

    Build and preload data to ensure instant rendering:
    ```dart
    await data.build(); 
    // Or sync variant for small layouts
    // data.buildSync();
    await data.preload();  // Provide the storage built into DivKitView
    ```

4. Use DivKitView inside your widget tree with layout passed by param "data":
    ```dart
    DivKitView(
        data: data, // DivKitData
    )
    ```
   
   Optionally, you can pass customs handler, actions handler and other params to configure DivKitView behavior:
   ```dart
    DivKitView(
      data: data,
      customHandler: MyCustomHandler(), // DivCustomHandler?
      actionHandler: MyCustomActionHandler(), // DivActionHandler?
      variableStorage: MyVariableStorage(), // DivVariableStorage?
    )
   ```

   P.s. If you wish to work with default div-actions and use your own actionHandler don't forget to inherit **DefaultDivActionHandler**.
