* Fine-grained improvement of the appearance of complex properties

## 0.1.19

* Made some kind of test edit on popups

## 0.1.18

* Made minification for files. The names of the dependencies have changed, but this should not affect anything.

## 0.1.17

* Returned the lost "list item" component to the panel with the addition of the component
* Fixed the adjacent text in long titles in the add component panel
* Tweaked the logic of selecting components with the mouse in the preview
* Corrected the error at the time of deleting the component and the hover of a piece of code in the json editor
* Fixed text sizes when editing with wrap_content and wrap_content+constrained sizes
* Redesigned the display of text editing + all property dialogs, now it should not be possible to interact with the page while they are open + fixed the order of closing dialogs if several are open at the same time
* Replaced the action editor in the button (I forgot to change it in the previous version)

## 0.1.16

* Updated the design of adding a new component, component tree, component tree menu, color properties, check box properties (constrained), json editor in a dark theme
* Removed the button with errors, as it is very bad
* Added new properties for text: alignment and underline/strikethrough
* Added alignment to the inline text editor, and also fixed the underline/strikethrough operation that affects the entire block of text
* Added a new property with actions

## 0.1.14

* The toolbar no longer rotates with the text itself when editing the text
* When dragging, the nested container is now given higher priority than the external one. And fixed interaction with horizontal containers
* Fixed an incorrect icon in the component tree that was "delayed" from changing properties (container and gallery)
* Now, when creating components, as well as when dragging them into the preview, all components try to place themselves at the end of the list, but before the cross, thus the cross should be on top on average. It won't work if the cross is no longer the last component. It won't work if you manually moved it to the last place in the tree
* Unified component creation in all three ways. For example, when creating through the menu in the tree, components are now created in the middle, and when dragging they get the same wrap_content+constrained size as with other creation methods
* New double-click text editing logic. Now it takes into account the set size (fixed/match_parent is one way, wrap_content is the second, wrap_content+constricted is the third), and tries to mimic the real component - it changes sizes, has a background. It should get better on average, but I admit that in some case I broke everything

## 0.1.13

* Added read-only mode. You do not need to change the layout - the editor removes the panel itself with the addition of the component. All dialogues were intentionally left out! So that you can view urls, gradient properties, links, and so on. Even double-click text editing was left
* Replaced the image selection dialog in the background dialog with a new one
* Set defaults for the background of the picture for transparency and image size

* I hope I fixed the position of the tooltips
* Fixed the redrawing of the text (there was an incorrect text size in some cases)
* Turned off the logic of tuning margins to the old values when changing the size to match_parent, so that it was visually more obvious what was happening
* I hope I fixed the z order of the panels
* Removed the extra arrow in the properties panel in Safari

## 0.1.11

* Fixed editor error when adding container
* The arrows in the gallery are now clickable, and the gallery itself can be scrolled (for example, with a touchpad). And the components update their frames correctly when scrolling the gallery
* Drag and drop to the gallery is supported
* The container and gallery got a new layout when added (the size is larger, it is more convenient to interact)
* Fixed a number of problems with redrawing previews (by the type of incorrect margins)
* Updated component properties: image, gif, container, separator, lottie, button, close, list item (in most cases simply wrapped in a collapsible group)

## 0.1.10

* Fixed the text editing issues that I added in the previous version
* Fixed adding and removing nested array elements in complex properties (ranges->actions, for example)
* Added a naive implementation of additional properties. It occurs, for example, in the form of payload in action (in the json scheme it looks like additionalProperties: true)

* Fixed the cancellation of the rotation (the very first one)
* When moving the component and releasing the mouse outside the preview, the selected element is no longer reset
* Added a minimum distance when moving, before which the element does not move (so that the selection does not blink when selecting an element and moving the mouse by 1 pixel)
* Completed the change of the order of the background layers: elements no longer blink when changing the order, and delete buttons are hidden during movement
* When switching the background type, the previous values are now reused

## 0.1.7

* Improvements to highlight text in the shadow dom
* Removed the theme change button in the preview
* Improvements to the text editor (link deletion button, return of focus after inserting an image, fixes for text loss)

* Added component transfers by arrows / arrows with shift (if the component is inside the container, it changes the order of the elements, otherwise it names the margins)
* Added component resize by arrows + Ctrl / arrows + Ctrl + Shift
