# Web Client:

Breaking changes:
* The `setVariable` / `GetVariable` methods have been removed (these methods were deprecated long time ago before opensource, in web version 1.11.0)
* DivKit now uses `BigInt` internally if it is supported by the current platform. This also means that variable methods such as `subscribe` can now return `bigint` values instead of `number` (and accept such values in json). `integer` values in expressions are now limited to 64 bits instead of 32, and the minimum/maximum value for `integer` variables has been changed. Note that outside of expressions, DivKit restricts values to 32-bit integers, as was the case in previous versions. Also note that the js builtin methods, such as `JSON.parse`, return a simple `number`, so these values may lose accuracy outside the logic of DivKit. Make sure that your values are in the range `-2^53 — 2^53` or a custom json parsing function is used

* Updated color functions according to the latest changes. Now several of them would return the type `color` instead of `string` (rgb, rgba, setColorRed and others)
* Components will now correctly unregister when destroyed, so recreated elements will work properly (for example, actions to change the current element in the gallery, nested state elements and others)
* Fixed logic of expression processing Previously, if a string was considered an "expression", it was processed as it, otherwise it would be used as a simple string. But sometimes this check worked incorrectly and processed expressions as a string. This is now fixed. It also means that some strings will now require proper escaping, so be sure to check this in your project (previously,these strings "just worked" without escaping because they were not treated as expressions)
* Now elements with custom actions can be focused, as it was with simple URLs. This would result to better accessibility in such cases (these elements also accept the keyboard input!)
* Fixed the visibility of the `gallery` arrows on desktops in several cases
* Fixed a case where`transition_in`, `transition_out` and `transition_change` incorrectly discarded the `alpha` component property
* Component actions will now wait for the result of each of them. This means that you can create an array using 2 actions: one to change the state, and the second to change the created component inside the state
